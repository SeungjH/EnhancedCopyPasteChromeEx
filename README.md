Enhanced Copy n Paste Chrome Extension

2/19
- Moved files to github

Need to Fix (todomorrow):
    - copy and pasting only works on the first tab that was opened.
    - first slot of copy and paste does not work.
    - paste can happened everywhere: it can change existing text. 
    - also, delete console.log("eee") and other stuff after debugging
