# EnhancedCopyPasteChromeEx
Enhanced Copy n Paste Chrome Extension

2/19
- Moved files to github

Need to Fix (todomorrow):
    - copy and pasting only works on the first tab that was opened.
    - first slot of copy and paste does not work.
    - paste can happened everywhere: it can change existing text. 
    - also, delete console.log("eee") and other stuff after debugging



2/21

Fixed: 
    - works on multiple tabs
    - copy and paste works
Not Fixed: 
    - won't work on other chrome windows
    - doesn't work on google docs
    - create a popoup page
    - double clicking the word and highlighting and then pasting doesn't work

Limitations:
    - won't work on apps other than Chrome
    - won't work on chrome:// pages such as chrome://extensions (chrome blocked it for security reasons)
    - won't work on URLs
